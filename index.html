                    <p>When I joined as Head of Product Design, Truecaller had achieved well established growth with 400+ million users worldwide over 10 years, but the design organisation hadn't evolved to match this maturity.</p>
                    
                    <p>The team consisted of talented individual contributors working across iOS, Android, and web platforms, but lacked the systematic foundations needed for design at scale.</p>
                    
                    <p>The executive team had clear expectations for design transformation to support Truecaller's next phase of growth, primarily focussed at increasing market share in the US.</p>
                    
                    <p>I led a comprehensive transformation of design operations, team capabilities and overall organisational design maturity through systematic assessment, strategic initiatives and collaborative leadership.</p>

                <p>Exhaustive initial discussions with product and executive leaders at Truecaller revealed the following areas as immediate areas of work. These priorities shaped my strategic approach and provided clear success metrics for measuring leadership impact.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Operational Excellence:</strong> "We need design processes that can scale with our ambitions without sacrificing quality. Our current approach works for individual projects but breaks down at enterprise scale, especially at the speed we operate."</p>
                
                <p><strong>Cross-Platform Consistency:</strong> "Users expect seamless experiences across iOS and Android, but our platforms feel like different products. We need unified design that cements our brand identity while respecting platform conventions."</p>
                
                <p><strong>Strategic Design Partnership:</strong> "Design should be a strategic partner in product decisions, not just making things look good after we've decided what to build."</p>
                
                <p><strong>Team Development:</strong> "We have talented designers, but they need to level up their influence and collaboration with engineering and product teams. They also do not have a well-defined growth path yet."</p>

                <p>Next, I moved onto have detailed discussions with all the designers, platform engineers and a few product owners at Truecaller, with the aim to identify and assess various process/people issues that were stopping them from doing their best work.</p>

        <!-- Challenges Analysis -->
        <section class="content-section">
            <div class="content-text">
                <p>Through a series of structured 90-minute discussions with all designers and weekly collective fig-jam sessions, we started to openly talk about and uncover various wins and challenges that designers, PMs and engineers were facing while trying to ship their best work. We went through an analysis of current workflows, tool usage and collaboration patterns. Cross-functional dynamics and relationships with PMs came forth as a key area of improvement from all designers and product owners alike. The following themes started to emerge and repeat through all our conversations.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Process & Operations:</strong> Inconsistent design workflows, platform-specific silos, and limited cross-functional collaboration frameworks.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Team Capabilities:</strong> No clear growth path for designers, skill gaps in data analysis, increasing influence across product teams, and systematic design thinking.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Strategic Alignment:</strong> Design decisions made in isolation from business strategy, unclear design principles, reactive rather than proactive design planning.</p>
                
                <p>Next, we also did a quick self assessment of skills with designers to identify Individual strengths, development areas, and career aspirations. These designers were creating high-quality UI work but operating in platform silos and decision vacuums leading to stunted vision in terms of how they see themselves grow in skillsets and capabilities.</p>
                
                <p>The team had strong visual design skills but limited experience with quantitative analysis, resulting in design decisions based primarily on intuition rather than data integration. And more importantly, no shared understanding of design principles existed, leading to inconsistent user experiences and inefficient design reviews which were led by product leaders who at times, didn't necessarily feel well-equipped to direct designs for better.</p>

                <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Platform fragmentation was creating inconsistent user experiences and inefficient design workflows.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Approach:</strong> Rather than imposing a top-down solution, I facilitated a collaborative design system creation process that respected platform conventions while establishing shared foundations. We also agreed that every designer would help me in their own way in identifying and adding to the component library.</p>

                <p><strong>Systematic Documentation (8 weeks):</strong> Created comprehensive design system documentation covering design tokens, component specifications, usage guidelines, and platform-specific implementations.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Adoption Framework (ongoing):</strong> Established minor governance checks during weekly design review meetings for new components to be handled, how to effectively contribute to component library and ease-of-handoff measures.</p>
                
                <h3>Results Achieved</h3>
                <p>This initiative once published, led to a significant reduction in design inconsistencies across platforms. We also observed ~40% faster design-to-development handoff process, especially for newly designed user flows. Improved design&lt;&gt;engineering collaboration with shared vocabulary and specifications, this led to ~90% adoption rate with both iOS and android engineering teams within 8months.</p>

        <!-- Lessons Learned -->

            <div class="content-text">
                <h2 class="large-heading">Critical Leadership Lessons</h2>
                
                <p data-numbered="true">1. Coaching for Data-Driven Impact</p>
                <p>Investing time in personally coaching designers through data literacy fundamentally transformed their influence and decision-making confidence. By pairing each designer with data analysts and walking through real dashboards together, I watched team members evolve from intuition-based to evidence-backed design thinking.</p>
                
                <p>The weekly data workshops weren't just skill-building—they were confidence-building. Designers who previously felt uncertain in cross-functional discussions began advocating for their design decisions with quantitative backing, dramatically increasing their impact and strategic influence within their product teams.</p>
                
                <p data-numbered="true">2. Strategic Quick Wins Through Independence</p>
                <p>During early days, identifying initiatives with minimal cross-functional dependencies proved crucial for building momentum and demonstrating design leadership value. The UX writing guidelines exemplified this approach—by focusing on copywriting consistency standards that the design team could implement independently, we achieved immediate visible improvements without lengthy approval cycles or complex stakeholder alignment.</p>
                
                <p>These "low-hanging fruit" initiatives created early wins that built credibility and trust, making it easier to tackle more complex collaborative projects like design systems that required extensive cross-functional coordination.</p>
                
                <p data-numbered="true">3. Patience as a Strategic Leadership Tool</p>
                <p>Evangelising design systems and principles across teams with different business objectives required sustained patience and persistence rather than force or urgency. Each team has legitimate competing priorities and timelines, so successful adoption means understanding their specific challenges and adapting the rollout accordingly.</p>
                
                <p>Rather than mandating immediate compliance, I focussed on demonstrating value through pilot implementations with android payments team and celebrating early adopters. This patient approach is gradually building genuine buy-in, though full organisation-wide adoption remains an ongoing effort.</p>
